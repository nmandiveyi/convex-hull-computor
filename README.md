# Convex Hull Computor
This project presents a Django application that computes the convex hull of a set of points. What is a convex hull? Suppose we have a set of points Q on two dimensional plane. The convex hull P of the set Q is defined, informally, as the the smalled possible polygon such that all the points in Q are either at the boundary of P or in P's interior.
